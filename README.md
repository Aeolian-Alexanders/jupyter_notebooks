# Jupyter Notebooks for Aeolian Alexanders
This directory contains the jupyter notebooks which are the heart of the Aeolian Alexanders project. You can find an excellent guide to the basics of installing a jupyter notebook here: https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/jupyter-notebooks.

NB: YOU SHOULD DOWNLOAD THE NOTEBOOK AND RUN IT ON YOUR MACHINE. Many of the libraries behave strangely when run directly from GitHub.

In addition, you will need to install [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) and download the [Aeolian Alexanders database](https://github.com/Aeolian-Alexanders/data/tree/master/sqlite%20database) into the same directory as the jupyter notebook.

For best results, you shold also install the [cite2c extension](https://github.com/takluyver/cite2c) to see the citations in the project.

The die study is also available in a traditional form as a .pdf, but this is an older version before the database ids and data conventions were stable. As a result it will not translate directly into the application and its findings will not reflect the current state of the database. It will only be updated sporadically, and it is provided here as a reference for those who do not wish to view the entire project.
